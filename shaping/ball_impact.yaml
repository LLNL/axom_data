# Sample code-agnostic shaping input for the "Ball impact" problem
# simulating a spherical steel ball impacting a stationary aluminum plate.
#
# The region of interest is contained within an axisymmetric bounding box that is [0,30] 
# in the radial direction and [-10,40] in the Cartesian direction.
